# My Internship Journey
My bioinformatics internship has been one of a kind, a life-changing one in fact. The four months I had at ICIPE were nothing short of wonderful with all the skills I got to learn, both bioinformatics and soft skills. The great supervision and guidance during this period of time provided a good working environment. The supervisors ensured that even when we lost our course, we found our way back to it and that helped a lot in keeping me focused throighought the internship. I have joy to see that most of my goals were met and I got a wonderful skills set out of the internship.

Goals
In regards to [my roadmap](https://github.com/Nelly-Wambui/Nelly-Roadmap#milestones) most of my goals for this internship period were met. I got to get proficiency in programming skills (R, Bash, and Python). The sessions we had on machine learning and data science, containerization and genomics made me know of the vastness of bioinformatics. We did projects in the last 2 months which were great for making use of what I had learnt in the first two months.

Skills
The internship not only led to growth in my bioinformatics skills but also in my soft skills. Bioinformatics skills I got include analysis of scientific data and workflow automation using Nextflow which I got through training and the projects we did as we got to handle huge scientific data. Our project was on analysis of 16S-rRNA data and from it we were able to do functional analysis and get to know which bacteria in an organism were responsible for certain functions in an insect. My programming skills (R, Bash, and Python) also improved as the projects we did allowed me to practice these skills widely.  The soft skills sessions we had, as well as the weekly code review sessions helped in the growth of my soft skills (presentation, communication, planning, and collaborative skills).

Recommendations
It was a good period of time but also very short If it is possible, I would suggest having it run for six months instead of four so that more time is given for both the training and projects. 

Conclusion
I am now confident about my career plan and this is as a result of being supervised and mentored by great bioinformaticians. I have started applying for bioinformatics job positions and I am also scouting for masters scholarship applications. The guidance offered by the great team of supervisors has been of help in making these applications and I am grateful for that. It is my wish that many get to go through this great internship and experience a journey like mine
